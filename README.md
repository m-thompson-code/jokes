Review on BehaviorSubject/ReplaySubject and shareReplay():
Creating an Angular Service that has the following:
1. Method that returns an Observable that publishes a value without having to make redundant API requests
2. Method that will make a new API request and all subscriptions to the first method will observe the latest published value

`npm run start` - run Angular app
`npm run server` - run local server (required for the share-replay page)
`npm run both` - runs both at the same time
